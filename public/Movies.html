<h1>The best movies for me</h1>

<h2>Not specific movies but types</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Anime movies and series</h3>
<p>Ghibli movies sometimes are hard to understand, sometimes they have deep meanings.<br />
Anime series, like Moonin was part of my childhood, and my adulthood.</p>
<h3>Disney and other animated movies</h3>
<p>Have to explain? Love them.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Harry Potter is now a favirote</li>
</ul>
<h3>Action movies</h3>
<p>Everything which are not in the two previous types.<br />
Superhero movies, funny action movies, speed car movies, fighting topics... </p>
